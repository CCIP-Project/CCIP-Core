# CCIP Core Repository

## Description & Coin Specifaction.

The Crypto Community Investment Project (CCIP) is a project which aims to provide a simple yet innotive and fair solution to cryptocurrency governance by putting masternode investors in control of the direction, growth & development of the coin while maintaining fair, reliable and private transactions for all users.

Community is at the heart of `CCIP` allowing users who hold masternodes to vote on worth while causes and charities for a percentage of the block reward to be donated to.
